Run each script with -m to show a manpage, or "perldoc /path/to/script"

Requires the following perl modules

DBI
DateTime
DateTime::Format::MySQL
File::Stat
File::Path
File::Basename
ImageExifTool
Image::Magick
Getopt::Long
Pod::Usage
Config::IniFiles

It will look for config.ini in the directly below the server, see config.ini.skel

You have to symlink the base dir into the web directory as "pictures"

Although this requires no web based server side scripting,  you cannot run this using the file:// scheme due to cross origin requests
