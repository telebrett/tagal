BUGS
* UI - buttons for tags - too long gets cut off to the right
* UI - image reload - the size / height is set against the old image

FEATURES
* UI - add a  count next to each tag to show how many images would be listed if the tag was clicked on
* UI - "notag" add a tag to the UI that can be selected that only shows images with no tags (except auto date tags) - could then filter further down using the year / month / day tags. Probably only when in "admin" mode
* Ratings - do image tags support a rating? Cursory glance says no, but you could just add a "quality" tag, ie not a special tag.
* UI - display tags for an image
* UI - galleries, consist of
       tags - which tags the gallery consists of
	   image for thumbnail
* Special dates, birthdays, christmas, NYE. Birthdays could be tied to people as well
* UI - Add tag as a negative, eg I want to see everything in August 2016 that is NOT tagged with 'Bogong'. Probably achieve this with an X mark in the top corner
* UI - Full screen view of an image
* UI - Download images as zip, not sure if achievable in JS, can we generate a TAR file in JS?
* UI - Admin mode, prior to commit, show pages of images with changes
* UI - Tag groups "people", "activities"
*
* UI - Local storage
*      Save the timestamp of the database.json file
*      Save _tags, _tagIndex, _dirty - this should probably be enough as _tags a hash of image ids
*      Need to be able to detect a new database.json file and merge the local state with the new database.json
*
*      Note a new database on the server could mean the image ids don't match, not much that can be done for that
